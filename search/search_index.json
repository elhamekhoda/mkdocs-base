The W boson further decays hadronically into two quarks with around 70% probability (branching ratio). In 10% cases the W boson decays into a lepton and a neutrino. In the analysis, electron and muon final state is with considered. Hence the total branching ratio (Br) is around 20% ( leptonic decay). Two major ttbar final states are: all-hadronic (50% Br): both the top (hence the W) decays hadronically. Total six quarks in the final state form six jets. semi-leptonic (30% Br): One top quark decays hadronically and the other one leptonically. Total four jets in the final state. Also known as lepton + jet final state. Feynman diagrams below show the two dominant ttbar process.","title":"Event Topology"},{"location":"ttbar/#getting-started-with-ttbar-resonance","text":"ttbar resonance analysis searches for new physics in the top anti-top final state. top (anti-top) quark decays into a W boson and a b quark in almost 99% cases.
